This repository contains the code to build various machine learning models from popular book **O'Reilly Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow** by author **Aurelien Geron**.
The code is siimplified to understand it better with precise & simple explanations that run along with the code.


In chapter-2, you will find a **Housing Prediction Model** based on various algorithms such as **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Support Vector Machine**.

In chapter-3, you will find a **Handwritten Numeric Digit Classification Model** based on **Random Forest and KNeighbors Classifier**. You will also find a **Titanic Model** predicting who survived the titanic.
