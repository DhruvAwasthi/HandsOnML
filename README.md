# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow by Aurelien Geron
I want to present my heartful gratitude to Aurelien Geron for this book. I'm so glad that I read this book and learned a lot from this book. I will always be thankful to Aurelien Geron to teach me when I was taking steps toward my dream. Thank you so much Aurelien Geron.

This repository contains the code to build various machine learning models from popular book **O'Reilly Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow** by author **Aurelien Geron**.

The code is simplified to understand it better with precise & simple explanations that run along with the code. Many models trained in this book use Randomized Search or Grid Search to finetune the set of hyperparameters.
